This paper is about the electronic transport with the interacting dislon, which is the quantization of dislocations. Due to the long range order effect, the interaction between dislon would be expected to cause observable effect in electron transport. We take use of the dislon theory to observe this kind of effect with the help of theoretical tool from basic condensed matter field theory. Interestingly, we observe a kind of Oscillatory deviations from Matthiessen's rule

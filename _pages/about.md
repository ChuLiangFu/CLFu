I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), now working with [Prof. Bi-Cheng Zhou](https://engineering.virginia.edu/zhou-group). 
My current Servant Class is **Saber (Mathematics->Excalibur)->? Captain** based on the calling.

Research Statements
---
I have abundant interests in **Applied Mathematics** with **Computational Materials Science** as the training domain. My research interests varies from pure mathematics to applied mathematics and applied science when I was a junior student in my undergraduate school. Though I am impressed by partial differential equations and geometry&topology during my undergraduate years, some physics related research experience(quantization of dislocations) and the great Chia-Chiao Lin's landmark pioneer contribtions in applied mathematics attracts me. Recent years, I am activated by prof. Weinan E's vision to explore the [new era in applied mathematics](https://www.ams.org/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf) with coherently integrating first-principle modelings, data-driven method, algorithms & fundamental mathematics & domain knowledge: physics led materials science.

Broken Thoughts for Memory

Well, I am always trying to imagine I am just a historian living in ancient China...

* 2022.07 would visist quantum measurement group at MIT.
* 2022.03 poster at TMS2022
* 2022.02 give a presenationt at quamtum measurement group meeting about applying persistent homology.
* 2022.01 Participate Generative Art from MIT IAP Workshop: https://gvarnavides.com/generative-art-workshop-website/, have learned something interesting with Nina, Jovana and Georgios!
* 2022.01 Move this homepage from google site to github page.
* 2021.10 Impressed by the presentation of professor Weinan E in Tsinghua University about the [algorithm era](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ph41187tU). One interesting thing is prof. E emphasis that *the applied mathematics people must understand the realistic problem* which matches my original expectation to enter into an engineering school as an undergraduate math student. 
* 2021.09 Take some rest due to the healthy issue(stomachache).
* 2021.08 Participate the [deepmodeling hackathon 2021](https://gitee.com/deepmodelinghackathon/hackathon2021) without teammates...Maybe I should have one to really finish my idea in solid diffusion coefficient calculation. But it's interesting to learn more about deep modeling and know some friends.
* 2021.07 Have many discussions about the future with some professor recently.
* 2021.07 Start to participate [machine Learning and Scientific Applications seminars](https://c2sml.cn/index_en.html) hosted by professor weinan E.
* 2021.06 Pass the dissertaion proposal defense. Thanks to my committee members: Professor Sean Agnew for Chair, my advisor Professor Bi-Cheng Zhou, Professor Zhigilei for advice from atomistic simulation, Professor Tao Sun for advice from experimental verification, Professor Kolomeisky from physics department for advice from statistical physics, Professor Mingda Li from MIT for advice from experiments and data-driven methods.
* 2021.06 Impressed by prof. E's [AI for science](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Kf4y1a7pe) presentation.
* 2021.06 Take the IBM quantum challenge and got advanced Achievement, quantum computing is interesting for me and I am considering to take use of the power of it for future simulation, but maybe not near future.
* 2021.04 Impressed(or actually depressed?) by professor weinan E's perspective: [The Dawning of a New Era in Applied Mathematics](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf). A little bit lost but start to reconsider the whole plan for my research or next step, try to adjust all my plan for the future.
* 2021.02 Supervisor Professor Zhou won the CAREER AWARD and would support my research for the left years as a PhD candidate(which means I don't need to worry about the funding for me, though it's not what I should worry about anyway...). Good news and I guess we would in the news of engineering school, lol... Hope to publish all the framework we build up for the solid solution thermodynamics soon.
* 2020.12 Inspired by Prof. E and Prof. Mingda Li, start to work on the consideration for combining data-driven methods and model-based methods for physical science after I come to more progress in thesis related problems by adding vibrational and elastic contribution in my thermodynamic model.
* 2020.09 Pass the qualify exam. I propose a method to design/screen the materials with giant mechanocaloric effect, but don't have enough moment to purse and publish anything due to the real applicable consideration for this.
* 2020.07 Help Professor Zhou submit the CAREER proposal with the previous idea.
* 2020.02-06 Inspired by professor Liang Kong, try to listen the seminar: [introduction to topological order](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/109585945). It seems I understand something and raise some good questions but most of them are not undertandable for me... But I highly recommend several articles in professor Liang Kong's [zhuanlan](https://www.zhihu.com/column/c_178032739) about the natural philosophy. Especially [this one](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/36610511).
* 2020.03 WFH is what? OK, fine...
* 2019.12 Start to learn with professor Weinan E's [principle of multiscale modeling](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~weinan/papers/weinan_book.pdf) and his work in deep learning for physics(molecular dynamics, as I just took prof. Zhigilei's atomic simulation course this semester), and is impressed by prof E's applied mathematics philosophy just like when I read the great Chia-Chiao Lin's textbook for applied mathematics: [Mathematics applied to deterministic problems in the natural sciences](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611971347?mobileUi=0).
* 2019.07 Impressed by Yiping Lu's work about PDE-net and learn more applied mathematics framework from his blog.
* 2019.07 Find out one of C-N Yang's interesting idea in his early work and I successfuly generalized it into my thesis related problems. Well, CN Yang is definitely my hero/idol from any point of view...
* 2019.04 Try to work on some non-commutative geometry coupling with disordered system idea and gain more sense in pure mathematics, but is not very successful.
* 2019.03 Prof. Mingda Li visited our department and finally had an interesting in-person meeting.
* 2018.08 Start my PhD at UVA computational thermodynamics and kinetics group.

I am a Postdoc Associate of the [Quantum Measurement Group](qm.mit.edu) at MIT. I got my PhD at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Bi-Cheng Zhou](https://engineering.virginia.edu/zhou-group) where I created a cluster-based thermodynamics framework that benefits computational thermodynamics. I am actively looking for my future academic position after my current Postdoc appointment to continue my further exploration of diverse applied sciences such as materials science/mechanical engineering/nuclear science/applied physics/chemical engineering with my applied mathematics style.  
My current Servant Class is **Saber X Saber (Mathematics->Excalibur)** based on the calling.

Research Statements
---
I have abundant interests in **Applied Mathematics** with **Computational Materials Science** as the training domain. My research interests varied from pure mathematics to applied mathematics and applied science when I was a junior student in my undergraduate school. Though I was impressed by partial differential equations and geometry and topology during my undergraduate years, some physics-related research experience(quantization of dislocations) and the great Chia-Chiao Lin's landmark pioneer contributions in applied mathematics attracted me. In recent years, I have been activated by Prof. Weinan E's vision to explore the [new era in applied mathematics](https://www.ams.org/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf) with coherently integrating first-principle modelings, data-driven methods, algorithms & fundamental mathematics & domain knowledge: physics led materials science. I am specifically interested in quantifying sophisticated circumstances.



* Focus, handle "disorder"/"random"(where science happens): quantify the "troublemakers" for the future optimization/design.
  * Mathematical principle for Solid solution thermodynamics: quantify Disordered solid solution with the probabilistic spectrum.
  * Disorder within Quantum.

* Information disclosure, Representations: characterize and represent abstract/difficulty observed in a transformed structured way, for better quantification.
  * Mathematical principle for Solid solution thermodynamics: free energy representations with CALPHAD.
  * X-Ray Characterization

* Time-dependence, Transport(algebra): quantify how changes happen with time.
  * Transport with defects.
  * Materials transformation with multiple transports.

* Spatial-dependence, Correlation(geometry): quantify how things organize and correlate and when scales/spatial changes happen.
  * Mathematical principle for Solid solution thermodynamics: combine cluster-based statistical mechanics with CALPHAD to quantify the short-range order.
  * Multiscale modeling: Time-dependent measurement for rare events?
  * Topological analysis: Topological Data Analysis

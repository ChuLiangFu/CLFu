I am a PhD candidate at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), now working with [Prof. Bi-Cheng Zhou](https://engineering.virginia.edu/zhou-group). 
Based on my calling, my current Servant Class is **Saber (Mathematics->Excalibur)->? Captain**.

Research Statements
---
I have abundant interests in **Computational Materials Science** and **Applied Mathematics**. My research interests varies from pure mathematics to applied mathematics and applicable physical science such as materials science when I was a junior student in my undergraduate school. Though I am impressed by partial differential equations and geometry&topology, some physics related research experience(quantization of dislocations) and the great Chia-Chiao Lin's landmark pioneer contribtions in applied mathematics attracts me. Recent years, I am activated by prof. Weinan E's vision to explore the [new era in applied mathematics](https://www.ams.org/notices/202104/rnoti-p565.pdf) with coherently integrating first-principle modelings, data-driven method, algorithms & fundamental mathematics & domain knowledge: physics led materials science.

This is a graduate level thermodynamics course. I take over the the homework solution, grading and office hour to serve for the student. The textbook is the standard [DeHoff](https://www.amazon.com/Thermodynamics-Materials-Science-Robert-DeHoff/dp/0849340659) but we add more content about computational thermodynamics(ThermoCalc) into it. The problem set would not be shared but I plan to design some problem sets to include some newly developed computational thermodynamics technique to share.
